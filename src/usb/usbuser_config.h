/*  WORKAROUND for artf44835 ROM driver BUG:
    Code clearing STALL bits in endpoint reset routine corrupts memory area
    next to the endpoint control data. For example When EP0, EP1_IN, EP1_OUT,
    EP2_IN are used we need to specify 3 here. But as a workaround for this
    issue specify 4. So that extra EPs control structure acts as padding buffer
    to avoid data corruption. Corruption of padding memory doesnâ€™t affect the
    stack/program behaviour.
